The selected code snippet is a C++ program that implements a dynamic array class called "array". The class includes methods for linear searching, sorting, binary searching, insertion, deletion by index, deletion by value, and displaying the array.

Here's a brief explanation of the selected code:

1. The class "array" has private member variables:
   - `tsize`: Total size of the array.
   - `usize`: Used size of the array.
   - `temp`: Temporary variable used for sorting and deletion.
   - `ptr`: Pointer to the dynamically allocated array.

2. The class "array" has a constructor that initializes the array with a given total size and sets the used size to 0.

3. The class "array" has a linear search method called "linear" that iterates through the array to find the index of a given element.

4. The class "array" has a sorting method called "sort" that sorts the array in ascending or descending order based on the boolean parameter "asc". The sorting algorithm used is a simple bubble sort.

5. The class "array" has a binary search method called "binary" that uses the binary search algorithm to find the index of a given element in the array. The array must be sorted in ascending order for this method to work correctly.

6. The class "array" has an insertion method called "insert" that inserts a given element at a specified index in the array. If the index is not provided, the element is inserted at the beginning of the array.

7. The class "array" has a deletion by index method called "indexDelete" that deletes the element at a specified index in the array.

8. The class "array" has a deletion by value method called "valueDelete" that deletes the first occurrence of a given value in the array using the binary search method.

9. The class "array" has a display method called "show" that prints the elements of the array.

10. The class "array" has a destructor that deallocates the dynamically allocated memory for the array.

11. The program includes an inline function called "input" that prompts the user for input and returns the entered value.

12. The main function creates an instance of the "array" class with a total size of 5. It then enters a loop to allow the user to insert values into the array and display the updated array. After inserting values, the user can choose to delete values from the array.

Please note that there is a typo in the main function where the method name "delet" is misspelled as "delet". It should be replaced with "valueDelete" to delete values from the array.
